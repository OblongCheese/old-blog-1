<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>oah! What a day today has been.</p>

This morning Carly drove up Alpe d'Huez so she could see what I saw yesterday when I rode up. This was also a sort of warm up for the next trip: Col du Glandon, the 1925 metre climb I did this morning.

Unlike the other rides I've done so far, the route via Col do Glandon is not circular (well, unless I wanted to ride down the same way I went up, but where is the fun in that?). I was following part of this years Tour de France route so I didn't want to double back on myself, and that meant while I rode, Carly drove. By herself. Up a steep mountain.

This topic was brought up initially about 12 months ago, and met with much protest on account of perceived and assumed difficulty/impossibility - not of me cycling, but of Carly driving a big scary campervan up and then down a big scary mountain by herself. Well, Suffice it to say she drove up and down the mountain today (with me as a passenger for half of it) and I wasn't worried for a moment. Neither was she. It seems that when you judge something you have never done before, before you do it, you are often wrong...

I rode up Col du Glandon. Well, I rode up 99.9% of it. I stopped at what I thought was the top because it was raining heavily and I didn't want to take the risky descent or freeze any longer, but where I actually stopped was about 100 metres distance short and 10 metres elevation too low! Fruitin' hell!

Anyway, that was done so we drove to Cinque Terra in Italy. Which took longer than we thought it would. But we're here now and it hasn't stopped raining since we arrived over the border and we're currently parked in a huge puddle that I hope we don't sink into overnight.
