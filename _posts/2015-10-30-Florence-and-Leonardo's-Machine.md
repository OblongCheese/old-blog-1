title: Florence and Leonardo's Machines

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span>lorence almost turned into another Lyon. But it redeemed itself quickly.</p>

We drove into Florence after dark. You think we would've learned our lesson by now that trying to find somewhere to park a campervan after dark is a bad idea. We did have a flimsy plan, as usual: go to a camp site, and if that falls through, park somewhere else. We had to opt for the 'somewhere else' as the camp site was closed for the winter.

We left this morning around 8AM and walked the short distance to the city centre. Like Paris, Florence is not a very welcoming place in the "early" morning: all the shops are closed and roller doors shut, the streets are a bit messy (nowhere near as bad as Paris though...) and everything feels a bit cold. However by the time we made it to the Uffizi Gallery, the sun was fully up and people were out and about.

We saw a lot of famous artwork in the Uffizi, including many famous sculptures and busts of ancient Romans. Also Botticelli and Da Vinci's  paintings. We visited the <em>Museo Leonardo Da Vinci</em> too which had working models of his inventions, and of course we saw the statue of David at the <em>Galleria dell'Accademia</em> which is pretty magnificent, but also just about the only thing worth seeing here.

It is at this point I feel I can say that I have well and truly seen enough paintings depicting Mary/Madonna and Jesus Christ. I mean, really. Obviously people in ancient and medieval times didn't have a lot else to think about because there are just so many paintings of a religious nature it blows my mind. Good thing we still have Vatican City to visit...

I did enjoy all the non-Jesus artwork, such as Judith beheading Holofernes as painted by Artemisia Gentileschi, and all the sculpture from Roman times, and basically everything that didn't have something to do with Jesus.

Carly liked all of it. Except for the entertainers in the public squares dressed as scary clowns who fought with each other and then randomly kissed people in the crowd!
