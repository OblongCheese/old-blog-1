title: Well, That Just Happened

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e just spent two hours travelling and physically moved about half a kilometre.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most of the holdup was my bad. Carly is using one of my old backpacks for carry-on luggage. Security had to dismantle and remove the entire contents of the backpack, revealing all of Carly's dirty secrets to her fellow passengers while searching every pocket for what ended up being a miniature Phillips head screwdriver that I had likely stowed away in a hidden compartment many years prior. Suffice to say, the added half hour at the security checkpoint didn't enhance our moods. But we made it through eventually.</p>
