title: The Countdown Is Real
---

The countdown is real. Very real. I have found myself become more and more aware of the date as the time between now and when our holiday starts lessens.

Have we got this?
Have we paid that?
Have we organised those?

I am a little anxious, but confident we have covered everything off. Organising such a holiday has been an all new experience for Carly and myself. We can only wait and see if we were up to the task...
