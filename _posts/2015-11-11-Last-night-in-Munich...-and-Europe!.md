title: Last night in Munich... and Europe!

We took it easy again today as now Carly has caught from me the flu I still have. We took a leisurely stroll from our apartment to the BMW Museum, where we spent longer than I realized looking at a combination museum/advertisement. It was actually pretty good if you like cars or motorbikes, and it would be amazing if you're a huge BMW fan, which I am not especially.

From there we had lunch in another German pub and then made our way to the English Gardens which is the largest city-park in Europe, a fact I learned from Carly. Another fact that we jointly learned together and later verified on news websites is that the park is a nudist-friendly park. We discovered this because we saw in the middle-distance (thankfully) what looked like half naked or mostly naked men sitting by themselves on the grass in the sun. At the time we were keeping to the shady areas to avoid glare, so thankfully we only saw from a safe distance!

Seriously though there was literally maybe five middle-aged and older gentleman naked in the park just hanging out (ha!) not doing much in particular. Apparently Brisbane just made South Bank Parklands a legal alcohol consumption zone. What's next, nudism?!
