<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he roads of Cinque Terre were not designed for campervans. Or even cars.</p>

We awoke to find the rain had eased and the massive puddle we parked in had drained. We got our bearings and headed toward the nearest town where we hoped to, and did, find breakfast, in a cute little Italian seaside cafe.

From here we drove to the first town of Cinque Terre - the five seaside towns built into the cliffs along west coast of Italy on the Ligurian Sea. This was an interesting experience because the roads in this mountainous area are naturally long, winding and narrow; the kind of roads you'd generally want to avoid in a vehicle as large as a campervan. Well, not us.

And not a lot of others, it would seem, because right at the very beach front - literally a flat, gravel area on the actual beach - is designated campervan parking in Monterrosso al Mare, the northernmost town of Cinque Terre. Getting there was OK but getting out was another matter. We had to fold our side mirrors in to get out of the boom gate. And again to pass by the trucks that were parked on the exit driveway by workmen setting up a temporary outdoor seating area nearby; the same workmen helped us through the gap with centimetres to spare on either side.

Then we had to navigate the blind corners on the single lane road out to the highway... it was an adventure, to say the least.

As for Monterrosso itself, it was cute. It reminded me a lot of Malta except with the recent rains, not as dry. The buildings and general sea-side atmosphere were nice and relaxing and it was good to feel the sun again after being in rainy overcast Germany and France for so long.

Tomorrow, Florence. But on the way, Pisa!
