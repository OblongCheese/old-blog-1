<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">C</span>hiemsee is a large lake in Germany, halfway between the northern border of Austria and Germany.</p>

We stayed at a campsite here basically because we wanted to relax. I've managed to catch one of the local flu strains so I'm feeling pretty average. All we did at Chiemsee was relax by the lake, which included me throwing stones into the water to see what kind of sploosh sound they make. I also showed Carly my technique for skipping stones across the surface of the water. All in all that's about it for Chiemsee.
