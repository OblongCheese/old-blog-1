title: A-maze-ing Châteaus

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>till driving. This part of the trip is long because we've travelled from the north-west of France to the south-east of France.</p>

But first, the châteaus. We arrived late last night at the <em>aire</em>, or what was being used as one, for the Château de Chenonceau. This château was built in stages by various people starting in the early 15th century. It's history is embroiled with French royalty and scandalous behaviour. Several of the characters from the show <em>Reign</em> are based on the real people who owned and lived in Château de Chenonceau.

Of the two we visited today this was the better presented. All of the rooms (with the exception of the museum/gallery in one of the halls) are set up in period status with mostly the actual furniture owned and used by the royals and nobility who lived there. This included the kitchen and other areas normally ignored by modern restoration efforts. The kitchen was probably one of the most well-presented parts with all original brass cookware hanging on the walls, as well as original butchers knives and tools and a saggy benchtop which had warped and bent from years of use and bloodsoak.

Combine that with the unique setting (the château was at one stage a square building built on the foundations of a mill, over the river Cher - a bridge to the other side was added - then this bridge was built into a two-storey hall/gallery - so the entire building now spans the river) and Château de Chenonceau is an amazing place. And I haven't even mentioned the gardens...

From Chenonceau we went to a château of different proportions. Over the years Chenonceau was owned and built by a series of royal women. Contrast that with Château de Chambord, a bunting lodge built for King Francis the 1st. Hunting lodge. The largest château in France is a holiday home. The two don't compare. One is about finesse and detail, the other is a massive, hulking, wide structure built like a castle. 

The structure of Chambord is even more impressive inside, it's just so massive. Each quarter of the gantry (the main building in the middle) was divided up into various sized rooms for various functions, the smallest of which being a 1.2 by 1.2 metre square space for chamberpots - a toilet. What differed between Chenonceau and Chambord in their role as tourist attractions is that most rooms in Chambord are empty. There simply isn't enough period furniture to furnish it all. So you must use your imagination (or pay €8 to hire an iPad with an interactive 3D rendered impression of the interior).

The exterior of Chambord is almost incomprehensible. It's larger than some of the castles we've seen. It's just stupidly large.

After having our minds blown by those two châteaus, we started the long drive to Lyon, which turned out to be another campervan unfriendly place. We slept overnight in some kind of self-service campground on the outskirts of the city full of caravans with childrens toys strewn about the road and a small but loud dog who greeted us at 11PM, much to the chagrin of our new neighbours I'm sure. Now we wait for the morning to keep going to Bédoin.

Oh and one more thing, Carly wouldn't let us go see Château ver de Fleur, despite my insistence that it is one of the finest wine-producing châteaus in Europe.
