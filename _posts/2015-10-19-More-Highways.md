<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>n average day is a bit of an emotional letdown, but without them you cannot appreciate the highs.</p>

Today was pretty average as far as our holiday is concerned. We packed up the camper van after staying at a self-service <em>reisemobilplatz</em> (motorhome space) outside Rothenburg ob der Tauber and drove to Heidelberg which was in hindsight a bad idea, which I'll explain shortly.

A <em>reisemobilplatz</em> is a place where motorhomes park. And a self-service <em>reisemobilplatz</em> is where you park your motorhome, connect your electric cables to a nearby electric plug, and insert 50 Euro cents to buy 0.5kW/h of electricity. You also need to buy a parking ticket to stay in the <em>reisemobilplatz</em> so you don't get a fine. In addition there are public toilets and another coin-operated station for topping up your fresh water and emptying your portable toilet. It's a really neat idea, and I wonder why the whole camper van culture hasn't caught on as much in Australia - maybe our population density is too low.

Anyway, Heidelberg is another medieval town with a bit of a wall and a castle and stuff, but I can only tell you that based on Google because we never stopped for more than five minutes in Heidelberg. You see there is no parking for motorhomes there, at all. The closest <em>campingplatz</em> (camping place) is 4km from the edge of town and it was closed. We actually spent about an hour driving through Heidelberg multiple (three) times trying to find somewhere to park, and in the end we gave up. It looked to be a bit of a tourist trap anyway as we spotted tens of buses unloading tourists and their luggage on our multiple (three) passes by the <em>nur busse parkplatz</em> (bus only parking) zone. All the parking was either for dedicated tour buses or parking garages where our camper van was too tall to fit. So we left that silly place and continued to RÃ¼desheim am Rhein, another medieval town with a castle on a hill overlooking the Rhein river.

Tomorrow I think we will take the cable car up to the Niederwalddenkmal (Niederwald monument), a monument built to commemorate the unification of Germany in the late 1800s. Maybe we will visit the castle or admire it from afar, as we plan to see a different castle not far from here tomorrow too.
