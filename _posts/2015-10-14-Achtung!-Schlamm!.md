<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e're off to a good start. Well, we were.</p>

We flew from Malta to Munich in only two hours and fifteen minutes. We landed and it was cold, but not too cold. Probably on the edge of reasonableness. We collected our luggage and my bicycle with ease and had lunch before taking an expensive taxi ride on the Autobahn to our motorhome pickup point.

There we were shown all around the vehicle and how to use it; there are a few procedures we need to know to ensure correct operation of the vehicles amenities such as the gas-powered refrigerator and climate control system, etc.

After a little time and medium amount of trepidation we finally set off from the DRM depot and immediately took a wrong turn. We didn't want to do a u-turn so we ended up driving a 5km round-trip of Markt-Schwaben to get to an ALDI and nearby homewares store to stock up on bedclothes and food.

Driving the motorhome on the 'wrong' side of the road was daunting at first but I got used to it fairly quickly. Still I am thrown by intersections without lines marked, but I've only driven through one of those wrong once so far, and we avoided another vehicle waiting at the intersection...

Driving a vehicle this large (2.8m wide and 3.3m tall) is a lot different to my little two-door car at home, but I'm getting used to it. We easily drove an hour and three quarters from Markt-Schwaben to Bergen on the motorway... until.

We were on the lookout for a camping site when we realized we had missed the turn. So we pulled off the road to turn around and the car made a shuddering noise when trying to accelerate. I opened the door and looked down to see the mudguards covered in mud. We were bogged. So I tried a few more times in forward and reverse to no avail. Searching through the back of the van I found the parking chocks used to stop the vehicle rolling down hills and threw those under the front wheels to try and gain a bit of traction on a non-mud surface. Also to no avail. So we decided to set up camp in a random field for a while and have dinner.

We eventually made it through the hold music to the 24/7 help service and told them of our plight. Apparently a man will be here to rescue us within 60 minutes. And now we wait...
