<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">E</span>veryone can name the famous landmarks of Paris, and today we visited three of them.</p>

We started out with an ideal to try and make up for a few hours lost yesterday, and we mostly succeeded. For whatever reason -- probably lingering jetlag -- both Carly and I were awake at 4.30AM this morning. We decided to make a positive use of our time and set off before sunrise (not that difficult when sunrise is 8AM) to make the most of our day.

We checked nearby cafes, bistros, restaurants and patisseries for their earliest opening times and came up with a few that claimed to open at 6AM. I say claimed because upon approaching several, all of whom told us to come back soon, we did not find a place to serve us breakfast until we were already on the doorstep of the Notre Dame at 7AM.

Notre Dame is a sight to behold. It looks big on the outside but it's once you get inside that the grand scale of the building takes on another dimension. The ceilings are so high and the pillars are so large as to defy what seems possible with stone and wood. That and the 'mystical' religious nature of the building together form a sense of epicness that I have not experienced in regards to a building before today.

Sainte-Chapelle was next on our list. We joined the line at about 8.30AM for a 9AM opening, except there were two problems:

* we joined the wrong line. The entrance to the Palais de Justice shares the same physical entrance to that of Sainte-Chapelle, and until the staff from Sainte-Chapelle erected the temporary queuing barriers this was not immediately apparent.

* after the Sainte-Chapelle staff erected the queuing barriers, we realized that in the month of October, Sainte-Chapelle does not open until 9.30AM. In total we spent an hour queuing! 

It was worth it in the end though as the famous stain glass windows of Sainte-Chapelle are a sight to behold. Extremely difficult to photograph, but certainly very pretty, and at nearly 800 years old it is a wonder that they have survived to this day.

After we left Sainte-Chapelle we walked to the Luxembourg Gardens, which are situated just on the south side of the Siene. Encompassing the grounds of the Palace du Luxembourg, the gardens are a peaceful slice of tranquility in the busy arrondissements of Paris. We had a bite to eat (nutella crepes) and learned that in France, take-away means take-away: you cannot sit in a cafe or restaurant after deciding you wanted take-away, we learned, as the proprietor hastily shooed us away in clipped French as we made to take a seat. So instead we sat on a park bench nearby.

Of course, we needed those crepes as fuel for the long walk (3.9 kilometres) from the Luxembourg Gardens to the Eiffel Tower. Unfortunately we miscalculated our energy needs and had to stop for lunch (and the best wine I've tasted this far) at the halfway point, in a little bistro along Rue de Babylone. I had a burger of course, but Carly ate <em>cuisse de confit de canard,  pommes sautées à l'ail maison,  salade</em> (confit duck with sauteed garlic potatoes and salad) which I'm sure was the best tasting poultry I have ever enjoyed.

Now sure of having ingested enough food and alcohol energy for walking, we headed toward <em>Tour Eiffel</em>. I made sure we approached from the far west end of the <em>Champ de Mars</em> to give ourselves the biggest wow-factor approach. Though I'd love to take credit for it, the sudden but appropriately timed parting of overhead rain clouds and subsequent bath of sunlight across the tower as we approached it was like something out of a movie that we are so very fortunate to have witnessed.

We walked slowly toward the base of the tower, alternately in awe taking photos and being harassed by scammers along the way. From the base we came to realize just how massive a structure <em>Tour Eiffel</em> really is. We also saw that we were lucky to have no lines for access to the viewing platforms via <em>escalier</em>, so although we had not planned to (in anticipation of massive lines), we purchased tickets and began the ascent to the first -- and then the second -- viewing platform. Traversing via <em>escalier</em> is a good way to appreciate the structure and engineering involved in the construction of the tower as there is only you and the checkerplate metal stairway between yourself and the ground far below.

Finally we made our way to the Siene for our cruise along the river. I took a lot of photos along the way but I don't remember much of what was said about the buildings we saw. Suffice to say the history and architecture behind a river city as ancient as Paris far impresses beyond the comparatively short lifespan of Brisbane and its river city culture.
