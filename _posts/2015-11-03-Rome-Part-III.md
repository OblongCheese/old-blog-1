<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ope is a weird word when you say it 20 times quickly. Pope pope pope pope. Pope.</p>

My affiliation with the Catholic church is measurable by the number of times in my life I have been to a Catholic church for a religious purpose: once. In fact, my affiliation with 'my' Church, which I think is Christian, is also measurable by the same metric: about five or six. That includes when I attended my own christening ceremony, at age 6 months.

So you can see how me visiting Vatican City is kind of a curious adventure from my point of view. We didn't go into St. Peters Basilica because the line was already 200 metres long by the time we reached it this morning. So instead we headed around the Vatican city wall to the <em>Musei Vatican</em> mostly so we could see the Sistine Chapel. I was open-minded about the actual Vatican museum but the contents therein was underwhelming. Wall after wall after wall of religious depictions in tapestries and paintings and statues, the latter of which amusingly all had conveniently placed leaves over their genitals.

You might say I'm not the target audience of the Vatican City. Or that me visiting the Vatican City and expecting to see something interesting would be about as successful as a younger, single me trying to pick up at a gay bar. Basically not what I'm looking for.

But we did go and we did see the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and it was pretty good, albeit smaller than I thought it would be. The classic "god touching man" painting by Michaelangelo is small and also very far away on a high ceiling, and amongst a bunch of other paintings too. Like the Basilica, this place was packed. We didn't stay long because frankly we have become accustomed to visiting famous landmarks with little competition for space. And the contents of the building wasn't that exciting.

That made our visit to the Trevi Fountain afterwards quite testing; it supposedly was to reopen today after being closed for 16 months of restoration works. This was supposed to happen at 1630; we arrived at 1530 and left at 1700. No fountain. It didn't run while we were there, so I hope the thousands of other people in the piazza had a chance to see it after we left...

Tonight is our last in Rome; we're off to a small medieval town tomorrow morning which is slowly eroding off the side of a cliff, then a long drive to Venice in the afternoon.
