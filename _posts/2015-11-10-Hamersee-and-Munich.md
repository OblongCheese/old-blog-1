<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>amersee is yet another lake in Germany about 45 minutes south of Munich.</p>

We stayed at our final campsite here so we could be prepared to return our campervan in the morning. We didn't want to get up super early to start cleaning so we started the night before, which meant that after cleaning the toilet and shower it was important we were in a campsite so we didn't have to use our facilities and instead could use theirs.

We also had a whole heap of clothes that needed washing (yes more glamour of holidays!) and unlike home you can't just hang stuff out and it be dry the next day. I tried that once in Belgium with our towels and even though it didn't rain overnight and the sky was clear, I'm pretty sure the towels were actually more wet the next day.

Anyway we returned our campervan with minor damage from a guardrail I hit three days ago in Austria (three small scratches on one side of the van - on the plastic bumpers), which I'm pretty sure will be covered by our travel insurance should we need it to. If the scratches can be buffed out or whatever there won't be any charge at all. I was surprised though that we made it through almost the entire holiday and it was only three days out from returning the campervan that we managed to damage it. Oh well, shit happens.

We're in Munich now just taking it easy so I don't complain too much about man flu. I think tomorrow we will visit the BMW museum and check out some of the historic areas of Munich.
