<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">G</span>erman Autobahn. "The Autobahn" is not a specific road. <em>Autobahn</em> is synonymous with highway in Germany.</p>

All of the autobahn we have driven on thus far is not the classic "unlimited speed" highway you've probably heard about. Though sometimes it seems that way. The highest posted speed limit we've seen is 120km/h, but as we cruise along at 100-110km/h -- the highest speed our campervan is really comfortably capable of -- many people have passed us by at speeds that make it seem like we aren't really moving. Australian cops would have a field day here enforcing the speed limit!

Yesterday we drove up a bit of a mountain to visit Linderhof Palace, a palace built by King Ludwig the second in the mid-1800s. This was a stroke of genius because it meant we could wake up and explore the grounds and gardens before 10am when the palace opened for tours: before the bus loads of tourists arrived. We literally had the entire outside areas of the place to ourselves for about an hour and a half, which was plenty of time. 

We headed for the ticket office just before ten o'clock and passed many other tourists on our way (mostly Americans), and as luck would have it we managed to tack onto the back of the first English language tour of the day at ten past ten. With all the Americans of course. But this lot were quiet and respectful.

From Linderhof we headed along the quiet alpine roads toward Neuschwanstein Castle, another great building built under the direction of King Ludwig the second. Construction commenced in the 1860s so this Castle is actually very new, and obsolete as a castle in actual fact. It was never finished because the project was halted after Ludwig's death.

Unfortunately -- my first major down moment of our holiday -- the suspended bridge from which I intended to photograph the castle was closed for maintenance. So I had to be content with a few shots looking up at only parts of the castle instead of being able to see the whole thing. Probably the highlight of my visit to Neuschwanstein was the epic pork knuckle, beer gravy and potato dumpling meal I had for lunch. It was great. So hearty.

We then followed the aforementioned <em>autobahn</em> for a bit before being forced to turn off and get a bit lost. One difference between Australia and Europe (Malta first example, Germany now second example) is when roads are closed for works, they're really closed. Not just suburban streets either. The entire highway was closed after a certain point so we had to turn off. A situation that neither of my GPS navigators could handle very well at all.

It took us a little bit longer than we wanted, because we backtracked twice, but we ended up following the <em>Romantische Straße</em> (Romantic Road) exactly as signed for the second half of our route from Neuschwanstein to Dinkelsbühl. Much more picturesque and scenic than the <em>autobahn</em>!
