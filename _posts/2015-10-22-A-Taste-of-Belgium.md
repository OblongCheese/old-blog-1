title: A Taste of Belgium

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Tour de France is a bicycle race that takes place in the European summer, across 21 stages (mini-races) and 3300+ kilometres.</p>

This morning I got my own taste of the 2015 TdF by riding the last 60km of the exact route the competitors took for Stage 3 of this year's race, through the farming areas surrounding and I to the town of Huy. Only for me the weather was not sunny and warm, it was cold and raining and windy. It was still good though. Most of the graffiti on the roads of riders names was still there... but I wasn't cheered by anyone like the TdF riders were, instead the only interaction I had with anyone really was a woman who got out of her car as I was ascending the 15% grade Mur de Huy climb who gave me a funny look as if to ask "why?"

While I was out and about being wet and cold and laboring up hills, Carly did the grocery shopping and bought me some breakfast which included an amazing rhubarb waffle. 

We didn't stay long or do a lot in Huy, and we also decided to give Brussels a miss entirely. After a week cruising around the quiet countryside of Germany we weren't keen on the hustle and bustle of a big city. So now we're in Ghent for the night having breakfast for dinner (bacon and eggs) and a bottle of red made from a  vineyard along the Rhine. Tomorrow we will explore Ghent and then continue to Bruges.
