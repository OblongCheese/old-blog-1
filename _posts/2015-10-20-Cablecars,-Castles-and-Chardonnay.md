<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nother day, another vineyard/castle/epic monument.</p>

Haha, no, I am not really that blasé. This morning we decided we didn't want to do any of the round-trip tours of Rüdesheim. Instead we took a cablecar direct to the Niederwalddenkmal (Niederwald monument) and had a look over Rüdesheim from a 300 metre altitude vantage point before heading back to our camper van via two (that's 2) different bakeries.

From Rüdesheim we drove along the B42, a road that follows the edge of the Rhine all the way to Cochem. This was harder than necessary because both our GPS units kept trying to direct us to the faster (by a whopping 15 minutes!) route via <em>autobahn</em>, so we had to employ an age old trick of sign-reading (and directing the GPS toward Koblenz, forcing it to route via the B42).

At Cochem we took a tour of the Reichsburg Castle, which was not the first castle we saw today. In fact we were glad we took the "slow" B42 because following the Rhine we saw all the vineyards and all the medieval fortifications (I think there are 14 in total, from memory) along the length of it. The Reichsburg is apparently the highest of them all, though the interior is a bit of a letdown because the castle was 90% destroyed by the French about 300 years ago and it was rebuilt as château by a nobleman in the late 1800s. So although the main tower and the so-called Witches tower are original from around 1000AD, the rest is "only" ~115 years old, so there is more wood than stone. The outside looks great but the inside doesn't match!

We have so far stayed at a camp site nearly every night out of habit/fear of the unknown, but we needn't. The van has two 10.2kg gas bottles which are used to run the heater (water and air), fridge, and of course the cook top. Batteries power the interior lights and water pump. We only need to visit a camp site to charge the batteries once every three to four days. So tonight we have parked up between the road and the Rhine in Cochem, with about six other campervans in a designated campervan parking area, but with no external connections of any kind, ready to hit the road early tomorrow to head into Belgium.
