title: Rome Part IV - Not Rome Anymore

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur last day of being in Rome; well, technically being in the city of Rome.</p>

We had a long drive ahead of us this morning. From Rome to Venice is about 450km and in a campervan, it takes a while. One aspect of this mode of transport we've had to adjust to is that any GPS predictions about time to destination are invariably short. Sure, maybe it would take an hour to drive 80 kilometres if you travelled at the speed limit for the entire journey. But when you're driving a 3.5 tonne campervan up a hill on a sign-posted 130km/h highway doing 80km/h because you got stuck behind a semi-trailer and you can't move into the fast lane because there's a constant stream of cars flying past at what looks like 140km/h, the estimated time of arrival goes out the window.

The same principle applies to driving a 3.5 tonne campervan with the aerodynamic propertied of a brick wall into a headwind, or a 3.5 tonne campervan with the handling properties of a rickety old fishing boat through single-lane winding mountain roads...

It probably sounds like I'm hanging shit on our little Fiat Ducato here but I'm not really. I have been amazed by just how far and on what roads we've taken it. And I've been amazed by how other people on the road just accept it and help us. In Germany and France especially, if you overtake a semi-trailer in the fast lane, doesn't matter if you think you're going fast enough because there is always someone in a Mercedes or BMW or Audi going way faster than you... so the truck driver will flash their high beams to let you know when you can move back over into the slow lane ahead of him and let the faster traffic through.

In Belgium and Italy which have smaller roads in general, people coming the opposite direction will simply pull off the side and let you through. And people will also happily sit behind you doing 20km/h under the posted limit on a winding road without honking or being aggressive.

The only time I've seen aggression from other drivers is if you hang out in the fast lane on the highway too long. If you're passing three semi-trailers and there is a fourth another 300m up, you best be pulling into that 300m space because you're already holding people up behind you trying to get home at 130+km/h. And they don't like being held up at all on the highway...

I could go on about this topic for days but overall I feel that European drivers are way more aware, accepting, courteous and decisive than Australian drivers. In other words, better.
