title: Learning to Be Cold
---

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ave you ever felt cold? I have learned today a new type of cold. Though I think it will only get worse before it gets better.</p>

Last night I had a good sleep. I know this because I dreamt. Actually, the small bed we have in the campervan is the best bed we've had all trip: our prior AirBnB locations have all had great positive aspects, but none of them had "bed" as one. YMMV of course. I prefer a firm bed that doesn't concave at my middle. The simple foam mattress on top of a flat wooden storage box that comprises our campervan bed delivers just what I like in a bed. Carly hasn't had any complaint about beds so far, but I'm sure she could sleep on a concrete floor with only a slightly damp towel which isn't quite long enough to cover her feet for warmth with a tuft of hobo hair for a pillow.

This morning we had an amazing breakfast of "Schoko Chips" cereal (think Milo cereal but darker chocolate and a lot crunchier) and milk (sorry, <em>milch</em>) before packing up camp and leaving for Partnach Gorge. Packing up camp included refilling our freshwater tank, rolling up the electric cables, and emptying the toilet tank. The latter of which was not as terrible as I expected. The chemical put into the tank before use breaks everything down and neutralizes odours mostly. So when you tip it out it's more like a slightly smelly brown water. I've had worse smells come out of containers left in the fridge too long which were then moved to the kitchen bench and left in the sun for a week.

Partnach Gorge was pretty and amazing. Pretty amazing. It is a large freshwater stream that runs down a gorge and a walkway has been built along the length of it, cut into the rockface over the water or tunnelled through the rock in some places.

After Partnach we stopped for a quick snack at Welchensee, another picturesque German lake with a cute fishing village complete with boathouses along the waters edge.

We then headed toward <em>Schloss Linderhof</em> (Linderhof Palace) where we took a quick look around outside before parking up for the night. At only €3 for a 21-hour stay, this place is good value, if a bit out of the way. We will do a tour of the palace tomorrow before heading to some famous German castles. 

The weather prediction tonight is for -1°C and a max of 3°C tomorrow.
