title: Public Transport in Brisbane
---

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</p>'ve said it before, but I feel so aggrieved by this that I feel as though I need to impotently complain about it again.

People in Brisbane are THE SLOWEST at getting on a train I've ever seen in my life. It takes people so long to walk on, and when they do, they stand about two steps into the carriage absent-mindedly looking about for a seat, but not any seat, it has to be their seat that they always sit on. And when that seat is inevitably already taken on the peak hour service, they begrudgingly - in what feels to me about one and a half times longer than it should actually take - sit somewhere else. But by now there is a backlog of similarly glassy-eyed, absent-minded zombie passengers that for all intents and purposes you'd think getting on a train is the equivalent for these people as deciding just exactly where and how they'd like to be executed.

What's worse is that these are all the same people who stand in a row along the yellow line waiting for the train to come to a stop and the doors to open like they're eager to be somewhere - not realizing, of course, that people have to exit the train before they enter, so they only part the bare minimum distance required for a single-file stream of passengers to exit, further delaying the entire process - and once presented the opportunity to get the fuck on the fucking train, they make a song and dance about it in their own time.

Fuck I need to get back on my bike.
