title: Medieval Towns of Bavaria

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>inkelsbühl is a small citadel in the upper Bavaria region of Germany with which we now have a genuine understanding of its cobbled streets.</p>

We decided to leave our camp ground this morning and drive to Dinkelsbühl because it was quite rainy and the camp ground is a few kilometres from the town centre. So we set a course for a nearby <em>stellplatz</em> (parking space) and made our way. We soon realized, as we drove from bitumen to cobbles through a huge stone gatehouse, that our GPS had decided to navigate us through the town centre to a parking space on the other side. So we had our first glimpse of Dinkelsbühl from the bumpy-yet-comfy interior of our camper van as people looked quizzically at us lumbering by, tyres chattering across the cobbles.

We parked and walked the short distance into town appreciating again the cobblestone roads from another perspective, this time on foot. Honestly most of the footpaths in Europe have surprised me with how bumpy and unpredictable they are. Back home every effort is made to flatten walking surfaces to avoid litigation. In Europe, you look after yourself. Surprisingly Carly hasn't tripped over, yet.

In Dinkelsbühl we had lunch - myself a "baked half Dinkelsbühl carp" - which was baked and then deep-fried for a short moment to crisp it up. I have not in memory eaten fresh water fish, or carp of any kind, so the flavour to me was quite subtle. I am used to saltwater fish which has a strong salty flavour (or fish and chips shop fish which basically tastes like cooking fat). 

Carly ate pork knuckle, of course. Actually I had pork knuckle the day prior and both meals were accompanied by potato dumpling which were pretty damn good. Think of a dumpling - sticky and a bit sweet - now instead of dough, it's made from mashed potato. Yum.

Due to it being Sunday, nothing much else was open in Dinkelsbühl except for the bakeries. We spotted something called <em>shneeballen</em> (snowballs) which are a sweet made from a long strip of shortcrust pastry about 2-3cm wide wrapped loosely around a wooden spoon and then formed into a ball shape, with plenty of air pockets. The pastry ball is then deep-fried and traditionally coated in confectionary sugar, but we have also tried shneeballen coated in cinnamon and sugar, dark chocolate, chocolate and nuts, chocolate and coconut, etc etc you get the idea. We had to try all of them obviously, to find which one was the best.

From Dinkelsbühl we drove a short while to Rothenburg ob der Tauber which is another medieval walled city. Except this one is way cooler. It has a full 1.5km wall complete with ramparts and fortifications you can enter and explore. It's like being in a castle playground when you're a kid and imagining a full size castle, except now you're an adult and it <em>is</em> a full-size castle and it's actually real and made from wood and stone and not metal and concrete.

Here we cruised around for a bit looking at shops and things, again most were closed due to Sunday but that's not why we were there. We had dinner in a nice old hotel restaurant and bought more flavours of <em>shneeballen</em> before joining the Night Watchman tour. 

The Night Watchman tour is run by an interesting man in full period costume including an 8-foot (2.2m) long pike-axe and candle lantern. The tour starts at the town hall and stops at six or seven spots around Rothenburg where the Night Watchman delivers in a thick period accent an informative and numerous account of the city's history. It's probably one of the best parts of our holiday for me because it added so much context to the visuals of the medieval structures we had been looking at all day.
