<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oday was a magical day.</p>

Magical in the sense that we started by having an amazingly good breakfast which I'm sure was imbued with a little fairy dust. Or hyperbole. One of the two.

No, today was special because we visited two places which complimented each other but separately represent very different worlds. First up was a visit to Warner Brothers Studios London for the Harry Potter studio tour. The tour is set up and run in the actual studios where much of the eight Harry Potter films were created. That sounds impressive, but really, a film stage is actually a giant shed, kind of like a Bunnings. All of the displays were actual sets used during filming, and it was impressive to see that up close they're very detailed.

We took a lot of photos and over two hours to work our way through the sets, props and animatronics displays, including a stop at the cafe for a cup of Butterbeer and some Butterbeer icecream. I think I was most impressed by either the Hogwarts Express - a full sized train and carriage - or the surprise display at the end, a full scale model of Hogwarts which stood over four metres high.

It was also fun riding the double-decker shuttlebus from studio to train station, which we used to great effect when heading back into London to visit the Kensington Museums; primarily the science and natural history museums. I had seen advertised before we came over that the science museum had a special cosmonauts display. Did you know that the Soviet space programme was the first to put a man-made object into orbit (Sputnik 1)? The Soviets also were first to: put a living creature into orbit (a dog), first to put a human into orbit (Yuri Gagarin), and first to put a woman into orbit (Valentina Tereshkova). The Soviets were first to many achievements in the space race of the Cold War but the Americans caught up quickly and after the successful Apollo 11 mission to put a man on the moon, the Soviet space programme faltered and essentially stopped. However, fast-forward forty-five years to the present day and now the International Space Station is only accessible via Russian Soyuz launch platforms due to the Space Shuttle being grounded, with NASA not having the funds to do anything about it.

Woops, went off tangent there. After the museum visits we walked through Hyde Park which is another beautiful slice of nature in London. Unlike Regents Park there are not too many Gardens other than the natural fauna and flora native to the region. This for me resulted in a surreal sensation of being in an actual English woodland, much like the one which Robin Hood or Winnie the Pooh might reside in.

After Hyde Park we headed toward a pair of traditional English pubs and enjoyed a drink at Nag's Head. We also visited Grenadier but being a Friday night it was packed with nine-to-fivers starting their weekends so we did not spend long there. Plus there were roadworks outside which ruined all photography opportunities.

We then had dinner at a lovely restaurant in an upmarket part of town near Hyde Park Corner. This was the best meal I have eaten so far on this holiday: smoked pork, braised cheek, black pudding and some kind of deliciously cooked cabbage. Carly had some sort of chicken dish with healthy helping of meal regret.
