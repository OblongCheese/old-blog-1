title: Rome - Part I

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ashing. There's no escaping it, even on holiday.</p>

Today was a bit of a relaxation or slow-down day where we did nothing much in the way of sightseeing, we simply relaxed at camp and did our chores before having lunch.

For lunch we had wild boar stew, which was pretty good, and I imagine regular pork substituted for wild boar would taste the same. But that's not the point, is it? We ate a stew made from wild boar meat!

Then we drove to Rome. We are camped in a campervan park just 10km from central Rome, literally right on a tram line 200m away that we can take into the city.

Then we went shopping for groceries at "DEM supermarcti" and Carly made tomato rigatoni for dinner, accompanied by red wine from the Chianti region. The rigatoni was amazingly good, and at only €0.99 too. For a similar quality product at home you'd expect to pay about $8; you know, because flour and eggs are hard to come by in Australia. But then, there are a few food items which are cheaper at home than here, red meat being one of them.

Now it's off to bed with fingers crossed the crappy WiFi here (at €1 per hour!) is good enough for me to watch an online stream of the Formula 1 race in Mexico...
