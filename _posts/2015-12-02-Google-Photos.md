The current state of Google Photos is somewhat of a mess. It has some great features which I am trying to make use of, but show stopping problems are preventing me from doing so.

I wish to create a Google Photos Story. This involves selecting more than four items, be they photo or video or both, and then narrating with captions etc. Google Stories will automatically place them into a minimalistic animated slideshow and also add nice touches like map animations showing travel if there are large geographic gaps between items.

This is all well and good if your photo metadata is perfect before you upload photos to Google. If like me you forgot to change the time and date on your camera... you're in for a bit of extra effort. 

Editing the date and time of a photo isn't horrible, but it isn't particularly fast. You may only edit one photo at a time and to do that you must open that photo so you can see it's metadata panel and edit from there.

I have one photo that I took while in-flight. At time time I was connected to the in-flight WiFi and somehow the location has been tagged as Dulles International Airport in the USA. In reality I was actually somewhere between Brisbane and ABU Dhabi. How to fix? Using Google Photos, you cannot edit or remove this data. The only suggestion I've seen online is to download the photo and had Windows Explorer to clear EXIF data. What a joke!

Google Photos has some great features but the UI needs to be more powerful.
