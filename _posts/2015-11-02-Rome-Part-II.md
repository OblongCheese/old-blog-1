<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">R</span>ome. Is an interesting place. Ancient Rome is bigger than I thought it would be.</p>

This morning we woke up earlyish (7AM), ate Corn Flakes for breakfast (starting to miss home a little now, I wanted WeetBix but strangely we couldn't find any... Corn Flakes next best thing) and headed to the tram station for the short ride into the capital.

We loosely followed an 'everything-except-Vatican' itinerary today, by visiting the Colosseum, Roman Forum (and all the other ruins), Pantheon and Trevi Fountain.

What surprised me most about all these ancient Roman buildings are the construction materials. From the outside the Colosseum looks like an "ancient" stone construction, but this is actually a façade. The core of the amphitheater is built from pretty-standard-looking bricks and mortar. As in, red bricks almost like you'd see in any housing estate in Brisbane. These bricks are different though, they're very thin at about 3cm in height and probably a bit longer than your average house brick, but otherwise they are the same thing. 

I had to reevaluate what I considered "ancient-looking" to include red brick and concrete, which the Romans also used to build the Colosseum, apparently. These construction materials were also used all throughout the other ruins we saw today as the core of the structure, and again all that white stone (travertine) and marble and columns is mostly just a façade!

I think out of all the buildings I have seen on holiday I am most impressed by the Louvre (sheer size), Westminster Palace (sheer size + Gothic architecture), Notre Dam (sheer size + Gothic architecture), and the Pantheon. The Colosseum is alright but today it is a shadow of its former self having been slowly deteriorating for the last 1800 years on account of earthquakes and its materials being taken and used for other purposes.

The Pantheon is not a massive building compared to others but it is amazingly well-built and the interior of the dome roof is simply mind-boggling. That sort of thing built today? Yeah whatever. That sort of thing built 1800 years ago? Amazing. It is still today the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. They used different materials in the aggregate for the concrete as the height went up. Heavier travertine at the bottom of the dome, then terracotta near the middle, then pumice near the top. It's amazing standing inside and looking at the perfectly round interior of the dome.
