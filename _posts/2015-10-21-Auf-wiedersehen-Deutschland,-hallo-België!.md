title: Auf wiedersehen Deutschland, hallo België!

Before leaving Germany today I felt it necessary to at least visit the Nürburgring even though I wouldn't be driving on it. I had pre-booked two 15 minute sessions in a race-prepared Renault Clio, but two days ago I received an e-mail telling me the circuit would be closed today, my planned day to drive. I was a bit disappointed but I've already done so much on this holiday it sort of doesn't matter. 

Anyway, we still drove to the circuit because it is mostly on the way to Belgium. And once we crossed from Germany to Belgium we were pretty much near another famous race circuit, Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. Both Spa and the Nürburgring are nestled within the Ardennes forest and are probably the most picturesque circuits in the world.

I was extremely delighted to see as I drove toward the entrance to the modern Spa circuit the tiny town (six buildings?) of Masta, where the famous Masta kink still exists today - the old Spa circuit incorporated public roads up until the 1970s before the new dedicated closed circuit was built. I drove our campervan to the full extent of the speed limit through Masta kink while thinking of the old days when that exact piece of road tested the greats of the sport: Sir Jack Brabham, Jim Clark, Phil Hill, Sir Stirling Moss, Sir Jackie Stewart and the likes.

Unfortunately at this time of year basically everything is closed around these circuits because it's all being packed up for the winter, but I did manage to glimpse Eau Rogue and Raidillion through the trees. I will definitely have to come back one day to see an F1 race here.

From Spa we drove to a sad safari zoo where cold and bored animals paced around their cages looking forlorn. Especially the cheetah, who did not stop pacing the entire time we were there, I think because his enclosure is within sight of the open area reserved for zebra and antelope. Carly liked the zoo animals and so did I, but I think zoos today are very outdated. You can learn more about and see animals better on TV these days, without harming the animals by taking them away from their natural environment.

We are now in Huy. I could not stop smiling at the Belgian houses the entire journey here from the zoo. These Belgians build the most adorable little stone and brick cottages; they look like Monopoly houses. I fail to understand how people can live in some of these tiny places. Some are quite large, even three-storey, but others appear to be not much more than four walls in which to place a door and two windows.
