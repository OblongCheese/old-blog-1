<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">V</span>alletta is like something out of a movie.</p>

Today we visited Valletta in Malta, which is a small finger of land protruding between Sliema and Kalkara into the sea. Valletta is home to <em>Il-Forti Saint lermu</em> (Fort St. Elmo), a medieval Fort dating back to the mid-1500s.

Malta, being a tiny island nation, naturally has a long history of siege and ship warfare on account of its strategic position during all the great wars and during the period of seafaring exploration between the 1400s up to its relative stability as a British colony in 1800. 

At noon in the Upper Barrakka Gardens every day a cannon is fired to mark the time of day. This is a tradition carried on from the 1700s where ship captains would use the cannonfire to synchronize their chronograph (sea-going clock) to midday.

We then travelled by bus from Valletta to Mdina, a medieval town with a difference: it is not a town, but a citadel (a walled-in village) which was so surreal it felt like being in some kind of theme park. Except it wasn't a theme park, it is a real place where people still live today. I haven't had much to criticize in Malta but I might as well slip this in now: for a nation so physically small, their dependence on cars is extreme. Traffic congestion is everywhere all the time. It was no different inside Mdina with the overall charm of the place placed slightly in jeopardy by the presence of cars parked everywhere in the tiny medieval streets. Ruined the authenticity somewhat in my view, and made photography difficult. Don't get me wrong I still absolutely loved the place but it seems to me like a better effort could be made to preserve the image of the town for tourism purposes.

That said, Malta has been probably the cleanest and most well-presented place we have visited so far. This despite the high residential density.
