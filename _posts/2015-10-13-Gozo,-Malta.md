title: Gozo, Malta

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">G</span>ozo is the northern part of Malta. An island separated from the main island of Malta by a five kilometre stretch of sea.</p>

We took a bus from Sliema to Cirkewwa and boarded the ferry with ease, though it was a close call as we only just had enough coins on us to pay for the ferry tickets - no ATMs in the ferry terminal on the Cirkewwa side.

Once in Mgarr we boarded our hop-on, hop-off bus tour of the Gozo island. You buy a single ticket and the double-decker open-top buses run on a set route between about 20 different stops, where you can hop off at any one and then board the next bus that comes along to continue the tour. The buses have an audioguide and earphones are provided which I thought was a great addition.

We essentially spent the day on the bus because we soon realized that after two weeks of walking around everywhere we quite liked the idea of sitting down and seeing the sights, for once.

We only stopped at one stop -- the most important stop -- at the Inland Sea / Azure Window. Here we boarded a 10 foot boat with 4-5 other people, donned our lifejackets and were taken through the opening to the ocean from the Inland Sea and on a small tour of the Blue Grotto, the Azure Window and the other beautiful coastal rock formations. All the while we were being tossed gently about by the rolling ocean, our boat captain took us near as he dared to the rock face of the cliffs - so close you could reach out and touch the wet limestone. Carly said this was the best thing she has done so far on the holiday, so I think we did pretty well there. 

We took a taxi back from Cirkewwa to Sliema, to avoid the massive crowds, and had dinner at the best restaurant I have been to so far on this holiday called Tri'Kris. One waiter in particular, a short, rotund balding man with a lovely demeanor had the cheek to joke with us but also took time to explain the items in our meal which we did not necessarily know about. Unlike other waiters and waitresses we have encountered he did not have an air of superiority or fatigue of tourists about him. We tipped handsomely.
