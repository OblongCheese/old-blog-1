<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Z</span>ell am See is a lovely little lake town in the north of Austria.</p>

We decided to go here using the exacting scientific method of looking on our map for a lake and then driving to it. On our way we went past a shop that was half cafe and half grocery store. Except they only sold groceries that were either alcohol, junk food, meat, or preserves. This is where we purchased some meatballs that we intended to eat for dinner. We also purchased some shnitzel burgers and fries that we ate for lunch.

We didn't have a lot in the pantry or fridge but we had enough: meat balls, passata, lettuce, cherry tomatos. A simple enough task to heat the meatballs (pre-cooked) in the passata and serve with some shaved parmesan with a simple salad of lettuce and cherry tomatos. This is what Carly did and this is how I enjoyed my dinner.

Carly didn't quite make it that far. Now, her story is that she claims the meatballs "tasted funny" and she was "put off from the start", but in actual fact I am not so certain that is how it went down at all. We had two meatballs each and after eating one of them, Carly decided she wanted to know what they were made from. So we used our translation app and typed in the ingredient list from the packaging: it turns out the meatballs are made from beef liver! They're actually a German/Austrian/Czech specialty, made like any other meatball, except the main ingredient is beef liver. Sometimes with a third beef spleen. I thought they tasted pretty good; I mean, the texture was definitely different to regular mince meat, but not in a bad way. It was smoother (I am no food critic).

Once Carly found out what they were made from, she couldn't eat anymore. She actually felt ill thinking about it. So obviously I have been reminding her often about that one time she ate beef liver meatballs.

Also, the campsite we stayed at was amazing. The lake that <em>Zell am See</em> sits around, <em>Zeller See</em> (Lake Zeller) was literally five metres from our campervan and across the lake there is a view of <em>Zell am See</em> and the alps beyond...
