title: Our First Night In Paris
---

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>as a little bit challenging.</p>

<p>We had been having very good fortune up until we collected our luggage in Paris. Both legs of our journey arrived an hour or so earlier than scheduled, so our total flight time was about 19 hours all up. It was still too long for me as the last two hours into France really wore down my patience and I was very grumpy.</p>

<p>Going through customs was quick and easy though, the first time I was able to speak French to  French person, I ignorantly said hello to the man minding the immigration queue. I did greet the immigration police worker with a bonjour, however. I wanted to <em>appear</em> nice, at least.</p>

<p>Our luggage arrived pretty much as we walked into the collection area. Well, most of it did. My bicycle was left downstairs and we had to spend 45 minutes chasing it up. But we got there in the end.</p>

<p>Catching the train was mildly difficult as even though we had read what to do and where to go, our cash passport credit cards weren't accepted in the ticket machines so we had to find the ticket office and buy train tickets from there.</p>

<p>When we alighted at our destination station, Ch√¢telet les Halles, our struggle for the evening began. First of all, my idea of carrying my bicycle around was completely ignorant.  It's so massive and awkward and heavy. Carly has already spent considerable time reminding me that she told me this already months ago.</p>

<p>Second of all, we got lost pretty much immediately because we exited the train station on the wrong street. Walking around a new city carrying 80kg of luggage isn't an ideal scenario for finding where you're supposed to be.</p>

<p>Third and finally, after we finally arrived at our accommodation, we couldn't figure out how to get in to the apartment. The key was stashed secretly but we had forgotten the location. A few frantic calls to our host and we were good to go, but, after the flights, the waiting, the terrible walk and being lost, our nerves were quite frayed and we were so relieved to finally arrive!</p>
