<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hames. Pronounced 'tems', the Thames is an historic feature of London across which many famous bridges have been built.</p>

London Bridge is not the bridge you think it is. Tower Bridge is the iconic bridge with two towers and a drawbridge. London Bridge is a pretty normal looking bridge built in 1974 with no real historical significance other than it being named the same as the first bridge built across the Thames by the Roman founders of London thousands of years ago.

Anyway, we learned all this after we went to London Bridge (though I am sure Kirsten told me about this already, I obviously forgot) and saw Tower Bridge off in the distance. That was OK though because really we were down that way to see Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, which Carly was happy about. We then crossed the Millennium bridge, the footbridge which features in the opening sequence of Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.

We walked straight to St Paul's Cathedral to admire, again, the sheer size of the building and its architecture. We also used the toilet here. One thing about Paris and London so far is the lack of public toilets - or if there are public toilets, you must pay to use them. Typically people duck into a restaurant here or there but some reserve their toilets for patrons only and it's a very hit and miss affair.

We walked slowly north-east through the London financial district toward our lunch stop, meeting Ross at a burger joint called MEATmission. Very atmospheric (man-made atmosphere in a late-1800s brick building) and with good burgers. And Ross was good company too, taking us on a little tour of Shoreditch and Brick Lane, the art/hipster area of London. By the time we finished our little tour it was mid-afternoon and time to head home to Camden Town to repack our luggage and ensure all was in order for our early trip to Heathrow the following day on our way to Malta.
