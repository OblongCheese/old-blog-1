title: Raining In Paris

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oday was our first day exploring Paris.</p>

<p>We started the day off by walking to The Louvre. Once we arrived there we took a few photos and marvelled at the sheer size of the building, and also the fact that were were actually physically standing there in  a place that we had seen many times before. The realization of actually being there was a humbling experience. Carly was very happy and excited.</p>

<p>I personally was more interested in the building itself than the artworks contained within. Carly, having studied some of the artworks during her uni courses, was engrossed in the paintings and sculptures. We of course went to see the Mona Lisa, which was interesting to me to see just how famous the painting is based on the thousands of other people who were also there to see it.</p>

<p>We spent about three hours in the Louvre, just a taste. We left to get some lunch and it was raining; of course, I did not have an umbrella. We tried to share Carly's but all that did was ensure neither of us were dry.  We wandered the streets of Paris through the afternoon and decided to go back to our loft to have a short rest and dry off.</p>

<p>The next thing I remember was Carly waking me up to inform me that it was 9 o'clock in the evening. We had planned to visit <em>Tour Eiffel</em>, but instead we elected to stay home and try to recover from our jet lag.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we'll have to try and see how time-efficient we can be to make up a little lost time!</p>
