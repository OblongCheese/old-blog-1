<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e left Bédoin despite it being a very lovely quiet town and headed for Grenoble. More on that later.</p>

After the testing time I endured on Ventoux I was determined to give Carly a taste of what I experienced. So we left camp early and drove our campervan up Ventoux. We stopped at the top and it was generally quiet, just a faint sound of wind outside. I told Carly to put on her heavy coat and scarf before going out and she was a little incredulous but did as I said. She was glad she did! It was 3°C and slightly more windy than when I was there the day before. It was bloody cold. It was extremely cold. We took a few photos and would have been outside for only 5-7 minutes before our hands and faces were starting to go numb with cold. We hurried back to the campervan and did what any sensible person would do with freezing gale force winds buffeting their car on top of a mountain. We had bacon and eggs for breakfast and enjoyed the view.

Then we drove to Grenoble for reasons unknown. I thought Carly wanted to go there and Carly thought I wanted to go there but in reality neither of us wanted to go there. 

So we left there and drove a little more to Le Bourg-d'Osians, the small town at the bottom of the famous Alpe d'Huez climb. 12km at 9% average gradient, another HC climb, it was pretty tough but after Ventoux yesterday it wasn't as hard as I was expecting. But then as the saying goes, "it doesn't get easier, you just go faster" aka no matter how fit you are, a climb like this is never a walk in the park. If it's too easy, you simply aren't going fast enough...
