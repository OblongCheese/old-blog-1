After we waited less than the quoted time (sixty minutes) for a tow truck to arrive and pull us out of the mud, we set off looking for a place to park for the night. You see, we had ironically been bogged in a field where camping is not allowed.

After the trauma of being bogged on our first night with the campervan we were relieved to be on our way. We set a course for a nearby <em>stellplatz</em> (parking place) and sighed a sigh of relief. It would not be the first over the next 12 hour period.

On our way to where we intended to park we took one of the minor highways. Upon approaching the exit we saw roadworks and police vehicles appeared to be blocking said exit, so we continued on and took another exit to find somewhere else to park. As we drove down a tiny rural road in the rain and dark of night with a stream on one side of us and fenced field after fenced field on the other, we started to wonder if maybe we should go back the way we came. We did.

We decided maybe we could take the previously blocked-by-roadworks exit from the opposite direction on the highway, and we were right, except we didn't know it at the time. With all the roadworks we missed the turn as it was marked only with cones amongst a hundred other cones; it is quite difficult to understand their layout at night in the rain at 80km/h. Moreover, I wasn't keen on testing out the emergency stopping ability of our camper or that of the people behind us.

So we continued on. And we made a u-turn at the next exit. And we came back to the original exit we intended to take, still "blocked" by police vehicles - except not. Again the hundred cones were difficult to decipher on first glance, but on our second pass we saw that we could drive past the police car and onto the slip road exit as we desired. We still took a wrong turn after this however and had to do u-turn on another semi-rural road in the rain and the dark in an unfamiliar and large vehicle in an unfamiliar place.

Finally, we were heading in the right direction. We saw the P sign for parking and indicated and began to turn when lo and behold, above the entrance to the parking area was a maximum height sign which said 2.4m. Our van is 3.3m tall. I leave the result of that equation as an exercise for the reader.

So we continued on, now quite agitated. It was approaching midnight and we had been on the go since six o'clock in the morning. We drove randomly along a road or two and spotted a tiny little side road with a gravelly area next to it. Good enough. I engaged IDGAF mode (Google "IDGAF") and Carly was now my hostage despite her meagre protests that maybe we weren't allowed to park here. My counter statement was that if anyone asked we could say, quite truthfully, that we were tired and lost and thought it best to park for the night than risk an accident. This, making perfect logical sense, Carly accepted as reasonable. So we stayed put.

When we awoke we realized we had accidentally stumbled across a cute little pond surrounded by the full spectrum of autumn colours. It was our first real look at German fauna (remember we had been driving around at night previously) and we were pretty chuffed. And no fines or otherwise for parking where we did, either.

On to the actual activities of the day: we went to Lake Konigsee (via Austria, where we paid a â‚¬120 fine for not having an appropriate permit for Austrian roads, which is another long story I might tell another time).

Lake Konigsee is an idyllic lake in Berchtesgaden, Germany. We took a riverboat cruise up to the far end, Salet, and had lunch there (<em>currywurst pommes frites</em>, curry sausage with fries). We then took the short but beautiful walk to Lake Obersee, an even more picturesque location which features in many photographs, one of which I have had as the desktop background image of my computer for some time. To see the lake in real life was something quite strange as there was a certain familiarity there but now it had an authentic feel with new memories attached.

Tonight we are staying in a proper camping ground with electricity and showers and all the rest of it. How wonderful.
