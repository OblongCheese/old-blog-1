title: Bédoin & Mont Ventoux

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e didn't stay in Lyon long.</p>

We left earlyish and drove to our next destination, Bédoin. This unremarkable little town in the south of France was on our itinerary for one reason: we would stay here so I could ride Mont Ventoux. Mont Ventoux is a famous climb in the cycling world with all the greats having ridden it at one point or another. The route is 20 kilometres long with an average gradient of 7%. For comparison, Mt Coot-tha is 2.2km with an average grade of 10%. Mt Coot-tha is given a Category 4 rating (categories are from 4, easiest, to 1, hardest, plus HC above that) Ventoux is HC, "hors catégorie", aka unable to be rated.

Let's just say that climbing Ventoux was easier than descending. Climbing is just a matter of turning the pedals over one after the other. Easy enough, generally speaking. There is a weather station at the top which you can see from the bottom. It is your goal and you focus on the weather station and you make it grow larger in your vision and you get there eventually.

Descending is another matter. I was unprepared for the conditions. In Bédoin where I started the temperature was 20°C and there was a lovely breeze. At the top of Ventoux the temperature is 5°C and the wind, I would estimate when I was there to be about 40km/h. So sweaty and wet self with wind chill factor plus wind blowing you and your bike across the road toward the sheer cliff face drop off a 1911 metre tall mountain makes for unpleasantness to the point of almost giving up and stopping at the side of the road to shiver and weep until your wife comes to rescue you...

But I didn't do that, and I made it down eventually.

Tomorrow I'm going to ride up another famous climb, Alpe d'Huez. It shouldn't be too bad... considering.
