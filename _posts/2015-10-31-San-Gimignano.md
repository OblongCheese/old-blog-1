<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou might be wondering, 'what did Carly and Owen visit today?' and if you answered yourself with 'yet another medieval town', you'd be right.</p>

After leaving Florence we made the short journey to Greve in Chianti, a cute little wine town at the very top of the Chianti region in Italy. Chianti is the name given to the wine producing region in Italy, much like the <em>Rheingau</em> region in Germany and the Barossa Valley region in South Australia.

Of course, there 'just happened' to be a market on in Greve, that we 'had' to visit, so we did. After we had breakfast first though, of course. Carly purchased a pair of small serving bowls that she liked and I had a look in a store that I thought was actually great: they sold t-shirts, cycling jerseys, and wine. Lots of wine. How good is that?

Onward to our next destination: San Gimignano, a citadel (walled city) in the middle of the rolling Italian countryside in Chianti. This place is possibly the most medieval of medieval towns we've seen, not because it is decrepit and horrid (unlike some other more modern parts of Italy...) but because the structure and arragement of the buildings to me most closely represents what I imagined a medieval city to look like. Streets that go this way and that with houses and shops placed haphazardly all over, towers that are placed strategically without concern for how they affect the citizens use of space because they are primarily for defence, and of course at least ten different types of road and path surfaces varying from massive stones to tiny tiles. The worst part about this town is that being on the highest hilltop in the area there are minimal photo opportunities which are not obscured by trees and more modern buildings.

We had a late lunch in an amazing restaurant, including an entire bottle of local wine. I had suckling pig knuckle and an amazing cheesecake for dessert. Carly... Carly had meal regret for lunch, I think. Or some kind of ravioli, maybe.
