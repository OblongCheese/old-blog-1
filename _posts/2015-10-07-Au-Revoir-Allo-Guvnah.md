<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>u revoir Paris, 'allo govnah!</p>

This morning was our final morning in Paris. I can't say that I was sad to leave. I did enjoy being in Paris to see the Louvre, Notre Dame, Sainte-Chappelle, <em>Tour Eiffel</em>, and cruise the Siene. I also enjoyed the high quality of <em>patissiere</em>, bistro and restaurant food that we consumed. There were also two genuinely nice French people that we met: on first arriving, the man who helped me carry luggage up stairs at the train station when the escalators were not working; also the man at L'Angle Babylone who was obvious and attentive to our needs as foreigners for menu translations and wine suggestions. But what I won't miss are the overflowing bins, dirty streets, dog poo, and overall feeling of haughtyness that the environment of Paris generates.

We took a taxi to Gare du Nord train station (I am sure the taxi driver sniggered at my pronunciation of the station name: that's OK mate, us Australians are larrakins at heart) and checked in our baggage to board the Eurostar to London. The trip was uneventful save for a minor delay, and of course as we arrived into St. Pancras International station in London the skies opened up just enough to dampen us and our spirits slightly.

However! London had a change of heart and by the time we had unpacked and changed our clothes the weather settled into an overcast-but-dry state of affairs. We began by having lunch (at 2.30PM) at a local jazz/blues bar (of all places). From there we walked to Regents Park and admired Queen Mary's Gardens while slowly making our way toward our first famous stop: apartment 221b, Baker Street, London. Those of you who are more literarily inclined will no doubt recognise the address as that of a mister Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective.

After browsing the gift shop we made our way to our first London Metro station, Baker Street, and subsequently caught the metro to Waterloo station (during peak hour of course, which was an experience in itself) where we were glad to be almost forcibly ejected from the train by the rush of people coming and going about their daily lives.

We walked along the South Bank of the Thames past the London Eye and toward Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster, which I was extremely impressed by. Of course, the Palace of Westminster is another of those famous sights you've seen a thousand times in media but cannot truly appreciate until you've seen it with your own eyes. The building is simply massive, and imposing, and wonderfully gothic and intricate and stark and spindly against the nearby office towers covered in sheets of glass. It's the kind of building that the concept of simply does not register with for someone who has grown up entirely in a young country like Australia where such buildings have never had chance nor reason to exist.

By this point in time my general uneasiness about travelling was much reduced, and probably more appropriately attributed to a nascent feeling of 'nonplussed' toward the French. It's a good thing I'm willing to give the French a second chance, otherwise I am not sure how they'd live knowing my currently generally neutral feelings toward their people and country.

We stopped and sat by Westminster bridge on the South Bank and waited 'til Big Ben struck six to signal the beginning of the evening. Again, by comparison feelings of cuteness began to form alongside imagery of our own town hall bell in Brisbane. We then walked along the Thames generally exploring until we saw the Tattershall Castle, which is actually a ship slash restaurant slash nightclub on permanent moorings where we had a drink and dessert.
