<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">G</span>roßglockner (Grossglockner) High alpine road is a really high road through the alps of northern Austria.</p>

The highest point on the road is 2504m above sea-level. To put that into perspective, Mt. Coot-tha in Brisbane is a whopping 287m above sea-level. The Großglockner is itself the highest mountain in Austria with a peak 3798m above sea-level. You can see this mountain from the alpine road at a special little tourist area set up specifically for the purpose which includes a car park, restaurant, and viewing platform.

Although the weather conditions were quite nice today, being mostly sunny with a tiny bit of cloud here and there, we could not see the peak of Großglockner as it was covered in cloud. But we still had a lot of fun driving the high alpine road. We got to see and touch and play with real snow! Well, it wasn't really snow so much as permafrost that we mucked about in. We stopped at a small frozen lake and I threw rocks onto the surface to see if I could crack it, to no avail. Honestly once the novelty factor of the snow and the height wore off I was actually put into a state of slight anxiety, which I think was set off by my slight vertigo. Carly was driving own the side of the mountain at the time... but I'm sure that had nothing to do with it...

The road itself from one end to the other is about 38 kilometres but we spent two hours or so travelling it. Once we reached the bottom at the other side we weren't really sure where to go as we were only three hours from Munich with the rest of the day plus two more before we had to be in Munich on the 10th to return the campervan... so I picked a random lake nearby to check out, and when we arrived here early afternoon we saw the most amazingly beautiful camp site to stay in. We are now parked about five metres from the edge of the lake Zeller See in the small Austrian town of Zell am See.

One thing I should mention about Austria now is that everyone here is super friendly. When I went on my grocery retrieval saga yesterday, literally every person I saw in the street or wherever said hello to me. I mean, as a woman exited the bank where I was retrieving money from the ATM, she said hello to me. As I went into the grocery store someone said hello to me. When I was walking back along the scary dark tree-lined road, four random men who were building something nearby said hello to me. It was almost scary how nice they were. Like something out of one of those horror films where everyone is watching your every move...

But we aren't there anymore, now we're next to a lake. So maybe tonight we'll get attacked by a lake-dwelling monster of some description. Who knows!
